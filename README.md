# SharePoint Online - Classic to Modern Interface
Basic CSS to convert a classic list to look like the new modern list! More at [davidlozzi.com](https://davidlozzi.com/2017/01/25/customizing-sharepoints-modern-lists-forms/).

## Why We Need This?
As users use SharePoint Online, they see the new Modern List interface
more and more, but when we go to customize a list (like adding custom JavaScript to a page)
you can't. 

My proposed fix, for now, is to make a classic list form look like a modern list form, and still
allowing all the customizations you want to run with.

## Usage
Grab the latest CSS from the dist folder, and embed on your forms. Done!
